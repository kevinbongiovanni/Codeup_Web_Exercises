	<h2> What kind of car do I drive? </h2>
	<p> 
		The car that I currently drive is a Lexus Rx 330. It is such a great car and I love driving it!  I have had this car for about 5 years now and racked up alot of miles.  I have been through many things with this car, alot of memories to go with it. Being made in 2005, it's starting to get on the older side so hopefully I will be able to buy a new car soon.
	<br><br>
		The one car I hope to buy sometime in my life would be a Rolls Royce Ghost.  I have always had a thing for Rolls Royce but they are very expenisve so I'll need to start saving to get one!
